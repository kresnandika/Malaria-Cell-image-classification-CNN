### Content
The dataset contains 2 folders

- Infected
- Uninfected
And a total of 27,558 images.

### Acknowledgements
This Dataset is taken from the official NIH Website: https://ceb.nlm.nih.gov/repositories/malaria-datasets/
And uploaded here, so anybody trying to start working with this dataset can get started immediately, as to download the
dataset from NIH website is quite slow.

Save humans by detecting and deploying Image Cells that contain Malaria or not!

Malaria is caused by Plasmodium parasites. The parasites are spread to people through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes, called "malaria vectors." There are 5 parasite species that cause malaria in humans, and 2 of these species – P. falciparum and P. vivax – pose the greatest threat.  source : https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria  In this kernel, I have shown the stepwise process of creating Convolution Neural Network Model using keras library for classifying images of Normal and Malaria parasite infected human blood sample.
