# Malaria-Cell-image-classification-CNN
Malaria is caused by Plasmodium parasites. The parasites are spread to people through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes, called "malaria vectors." There are 5 parasite species that cause malaria in humans, and 2 of these species – P. falciparum and P. vivax – pose the greatest threat.  source : https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malaria  In this kernel, I have shown the stepwise process of creating Convolution Neural Network Model using keras library for classifying images of Normal and Malaria parasite infected human blood sample.
